# Design-of-Canonical-LR-Parser
The CLR parser stands for canonical LR parser. It is a more powerful LR parser. It  makes use of lookahead symbols. This method uses a large set of items called LR(1) items.  The main difference between LR(0) and LR(1) items is that, in LR(1) items, it is possible to  carry more information in a state, which will rule out useless reduction states. This extra  information is incorporated into the state by the lookahead symbol. The general syntax  become[A->∝.B , a] where A->∝.B is the production and a is a terminal or right end marker  $LR(1) items=LR(0) items + look ahead.
